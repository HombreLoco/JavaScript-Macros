> Interactive workshop exploring macros and Javascript using sweet.js

# Intro

Welcome! This workshop provides an introduction to the world of Macros in Javascript! This workshop is a _code-along_, so you'll need to go through few steps to follow along:

**Get Setup**

Open up your favourite terminal (or least favourite, I guess) and proceed:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:teesloane/macro-workshop.git

# Install our dependencies!
npm install

# Boot it up!
npm run start

```

# Resources

- I've compiled some [notes and references](resources/notes.md) for further readings on macros and other related topics.
- we'll be using [sweet.js](https://www.sweetjs.org/) for this workshop. Note that we're using an [older](http://www.sweetjs.org/doc/main/sweet.html) version of this library that lets us build more cool things, like infix macros and the `|>` operator.
